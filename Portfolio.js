                        <h3>The First Project</h3>
                            <p>This  book  is  largely  concerned  with  Hobbits,  and  from  its pages  a  reader  may  discover  much  of  their  character  and  a little  of  their  history.  Further  information  will  also  be  found in  the  selection  from  the  Red  Book  of  Westmarch  that  has already  been  published,  under  the  title  of  The  Hobbit.  That story  was  derived  from  the  earlier  chapters  of  the  Red  Book, composed  by  Bilbo  himself,  the  first  Hobbit  to  become famous  in  the  world  at  large,  and  called  by  him  There  and Back  Again ,  since  they  told  of  his  journey  into  the  East  and his  return:  an  adventure  which  later  involved  all  the  Hobbits in  the  great  events  of  that  Age  that  are  here  related.</p>

                            <p>Many,  however,  may  wish  to  know  more  about  this  reÂ¬ markable  people  from  the  outset,  while  some  may  not  possess the  earlier  book.  For  such  readers  a  few  notes  on  the  more important  points  are  here  collected  from  Hobbit-lore,  and the  first  adventure  is  briefly  recalled.</p>
