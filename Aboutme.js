                    <h2>When I'm not programming at home</h2>
                    <p>Hobbits  are  an  unobtrusive  but  very  ancient  people,  more numerous  formerly  than  they  are  today;  for  they  love  peace and  quiet  and  good  tilled  earth:  a  well-ordered  and  well- farmed  countryside  was  their  favourite  haunt.  They  do  not and  did  not  understand  or  like  machines  more  complicated than  a  forge-bellows,  a  water-mill,  or  a  hand-loom,  though they  were  skilful  with  tools.  Even  in  ancient  days  they were,  as  a  rule,  shy  of  ‘the  Big  Folk’,  as  they  call  us,  and now  they  avoid  us  with  dismay  and  are  becoming  hard  to find.  They  are  quick  of  hearing  and  sharp-eyed,  and  though they  are  inclined  to  be  fat  and  do  not  hurry  unnecessarily,  they are  nonetheless  nimble  and  deft  in  their  movements.</p>

                    <p>For  they  are  a  little  people,  smaller  than  Dwarves:  less  stout and  stocky,  that  is,  even  when  they  are  not  actually  much shorter.  Their  height  is  variable,  ranging  between  two  and four  feet  of  our  measure.  They  seldom  now  reach  three  feet; but  they  have  dwindled,  they  say,  and  in  ancient  days  they were  taller.  According  to  the  Red  Book,  Bandobras  Took (Bullroarer),  son  of  Isumbras  the  Third,  was  four  foot  five and  able  to  ride  a  horse.  He  was  surpassed  in  all  Hobbit records  only  by  two  famous  characters  of  old;  but  that  curious matter  is  dealt  with  in  this  book.</p>
